# 1. Problem and Solution
## 1.1 Problem Statement
The Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) has various labs, each with its website in addition to the central DRDO websites. Each of these websites has a search bar which allows the user to search the contents of the website, but this search bar is not smart and has 2 major shortcomings:

1. There are no 'Autocomplete Suggestions' integrated into the search bar
2. The search results do not provide a summary related to the search query

During my internship at the Defence Scientific Information & Documentation Centre (DESIDOC), which manages all the websites of DRDO, I was given the task of proposing a solution by which the search bar can be made 'smart'.
